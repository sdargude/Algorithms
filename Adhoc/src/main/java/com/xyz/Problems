ITerative solution for tree traversals

    K the smallest element in BST
    Kth largest element in BST push rightmost
    2nd largest element in BST


Hieght of a K-array tree
BST from sorted array

Given an array shuffle, so that all outcome are equal in all cases

-Clarification:
    Shuffle ? Rearrange.
    Outcome? What the heck are all outcome? ask.
            - Is it all permutations of array? Yes.
                - Entire array or subarray?yes

            - Probability of each outcome is same.

            Still not clear, lets take example

                [1,2,3] given array. We have to write a function Æ’ which gives shuffled array

                 -[3,2,1]

                E.g. if you toss a coin, you may get H or T. so proability is of getting H or T, if you do infinite
                repeatition is 50%.



                How many permutations of array of N? it is N! what is the propability of getting 1/N!.

                Brute force:



- Binary Search (in sorted array with duplicate element) in log(N).

    Find the first occurance of a number.
        - midddle element or go left or right.

    Find the last occurance of a number.
        - Middle element or go to left or right.

    Find the smallest number greater than given number.

    Find the largest number given than given number.
